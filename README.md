# Living-Memory-mini-website
this website is dangerously romantic. The kind of thing she remember years later. 🖤 This starter “Living Memory” mini-website in the canvas — a single-file private love space.
How this impresses her (why this works)

This isn’t flashy — it’s intentional. It says:

“I’m thinking long-term.”

“I notice moments.”

“I’m building something that grows with us.”

That hits way harder than grand gestures.
